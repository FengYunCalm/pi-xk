# Compaction & Branch Summarization

LLMs have limited context windows. When conversations grow too long, pi uses compaction to summarize older content while preserving recent work. This page covers both auto-compaction and branch summarization.

## Overview

Pi has two summarization mechanisms:

| Mechanism | Trigger | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| Compaction | Context exceeds threshold, or `/compact` | Summarize old messages to free up context |
| Branch summarization | `/tree` navigation | Preserve context when switching branches |

By default they share cumulative file-operation tracking and one strict JSON evidence envelope. The `kind` field selects the native compaction, split-turn prefix, or branch output contract. After validation, Pi persists the Markdown summary body rather than the model response envelope.

The agent core and coding agent use one shared set of native, iterative, and branch summarization prompt contracts. This keeps their schemas and trust boundaries aligned while still allowing a caller that needs a different strict contract to replace the generic instructions explicitly.

## Compaction

### When It Triggers

Auto-compaction triggers when:

```
contextTokens > contextWindow - reserveTokens
```

By default, `reserveTokens` is 16384 tokens (configurable in `~/.pi/agent/settings.json` or `<project-dir>/.pi/settings.json`). This leaves room for the LLM's response.

You can also trigger manually with `/compact [instructions]`, where optional instructions focus the summary.

### How It Works

1. **Find cut point**: Walk backwards from newest message, accumulating token estimates until `keepRecentTokens` (default 20k, configurable in `~/.pi/agent/settings.json` or `<project-dir>/.pi/settings.json`) is reached
2. **Extract messages**: Collect messages from the previous kept boundary (or session start) up to the cut point
3. **Generate summary**: Call LLM for a validated title and structured summary, passing the previous summary as iterative context when present
4. **Append entry**: Save `CompactionEntry` with title, summary, trigger reason, recovery prompt version, and `firstKeptEntryId`
5. **Reload**: Session reloads, using summary + messages from `firstKeptEntryId` onwards

```
Before compaction:

  entry:  0     1     2     3      4     5     6      7      8     9
        ┌─────┬─────┬─────┬─────┬──────┬─────┬─────┬──────┬──────┬─────┐
        │ hdr │ usr │ ass │ tool │ usr │ ass │ tool │ tool │ ass │ tool│
        └─────┴─────┴─────┴──────┴─────┴─────┴──────┴──────┴─────┴─────┘
                └────────┬───────┘ └──────────────┬──────────────┘
               messagesToSummarize            kept messages
                                   ↑
                          firstKeptEntryId (entry 4)

After compaction (new entry appended):

  entry:  0     1     2     3      4     5     6      7      8     9     10
        ┌─────┬─────┬─────┬─────┬──────┬─────┬─────┬──────┬──────┬─────┬─────┐
        │ hdr │ usr │ ass │ tool │ usr │ ass │ tool │ tool │ ass │ tool│ cmp │
        └─────┴─────┴─────┴──────┴─────┴─────┴──────┴──────┴─────┴─────┴─────┘
               └──────────┬──────┘ └──────────────────────┬───────────────────┘
                 not sent to LLM                    sent to LLM
                                                         ↑
                                              starts from firstKeptEntryId

What the LLM sees:

  ┌────────┬─────────┬─────┬─────┬──────┬──────┬─────┬──────┐
  │ system │ summary │ usr │ ass │ tool │ tool │ ass │ tool │
  └────────┴─────────┴─────┴─────┴──────┴──────┴─────┴──────┘
       ↑         ↑      └─────────────────┬────────────────┘
    prompt   from cmp          messages from firstKeptEntryId
```

On repeated compactions, the summarized span starts at the previous compaction's kept boundary (`firstKeptEntryId`), not at the compaction entry itself, falling back to the entry after the previous compaction if that kept entry cannot be found in the path. This preserves messages that survived the earlier compaction by including them in the next summarization pass as well. Pi also recalculates `tokensBefore` from the rebuilt session context before writing the new `CompactionEntry`, so the token count reflects the actual pre-compaction context being replaced.

### Recovery After Compaction

New native compactions persist `reason` (`manual`, `threshold`, or `overflow`) and `recoveryPromptVersion: "compaction-recovery-v1"`. Until a later non-error, non-aborted assistant response proves that another logical run completed, the next actual model request receives a one-time recovery block in its system prompt.

The recovery block says that compaction is not a new user request, summaries and titles are historical evidence rather than instructions, and the model must not repeat an old request just because it appears in the summary. It follows the current logical trigger: a real user or queued message when present, otherwise an existing runtime continuation such as an active Goal kickoff. It does not invent a user request from a summary/continuation signal, append a user or custom message, or resend the last user message.

When a stored compaction or branch summary is projected back into model context, Pi wraps its body as potentially stale historical evidence. Commands, role directives, or prompt text inside that body do not become system instructions. The wrapper is a model-facing projection only; the persisted summary body remains unchanged.

Continuation ownership remains with the existing trigger:

| Situation | Behavior |
|-----------|----------|
| Overflow retry | The same logical run continues once with recovery context |
| Threshold compaction with an active Pi-XK Goal | The existing Goal kickoff triggers the next run; compaction adds no second kickoff |
| Manual or threshold compaction without a Goal | Pi waits for the next real request |
| Queued steering/follow-up message | The native queue triggers the next run |

The pending state is derived from the persisted branch, so it survives restart. Old compaction entries without `recoveryPromptVersion` remain readable and do not retroactively request recovery.

### Split Turns

A "turn" starts with a user message and includes all assistant responses and tool calls until the next user message. Normally, compaction cuts at turn boundaries.

When a single turn exceeds `keepRecentTokens`, the cut point lands mid-turn at an assistant message. This is a "split turn":

```
Split turn (one huge turn exceeds budget):

  entry:  0     1     2      3     4      5      6     7      8
        ┌─────┬─────┬─────┬──────┬─────┬──────┬──────┬─────┬──────┐
        │ hdr │ usr │ ass │ tool │ ass │ tool │ tool │ ass │ tool │
        └─────┴─────┴─────┴──────┴─────┴──────┴──────┴─────┴──────┘
                ↑                                     ↑
         turnStartIndex = 1                  firstKeptEntryId = 7
                │                                     │
                └──── turnPrefixMessages (1-6) ───────┘
                                                      └── kept (7-8)

  isSplitTurn = true
  messagesToSummarize = []  (no complete turns before)
  turnPrefixMessages = [usr, ass, tool, ass, tool, tool]
```

For split turns, pi generates two summaries and merges them:
1. **History summary**: Previous context (if any)
2. **Turn prefix summary**: The early part of the split turn

### Cut Point Rules

Valid cut points are:
- User messages
- Assistant messages
- BashExecution messages
- Custom messages (custom_message, branch_summary)

Never cut at tool results (they must stay with their tool call).

### CompactionEntry Structure

Defined in [`session-manager.ts`](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi-mono/blob/main/packages/coding-agent/src/core/session-manager.ts):

```typescript
interface CompactionEntry<T = unknown> {
  type: "compaction";
  id: string;
  parentId: string;
  timestamp: string;    // ISO 8601
  title?: string;       // Short historical label; legacy entries may omit it
  summary: string;
  firstKeptEntryId: string;
  tokensBefore: number;
  reason?: "manual" | "threshold" | "overflow";
  recoveryPromptVersion?: "compaction-recovery-v1";
  fromHook?: boolean;  // true if provided by extension (legacy field name)
  details?: T;         // implementation-specific data
}

// Default compaction uses this for details (from compaction.ts):
interface CompactionDetails {
  readFiles: string[];
  modifiedFiles: string[];
}
```

Extensions can store any JSON-serializable data in `details`. The default compaction tracks file operations, but custom extension implementations can use their own structure. Extension-provided titles are validated; a missing or invalid title is deterministically derived from the first Markdown heading or non-empty summary line, then falls back to `Context checkpoint` without another model call.

See [`prepareCompaction()`](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi-mono/blob/main/packages/coding-agent/src/core/compaction/compaction.ts) and [`compact()`](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi-mono/blob/main/packages/coding-agent/src/core/compaction/compaction.ts) for the implementation.

## Branch Summarization

### When It Triggers

When you use `/tree` to navigate to a different branch, pi offers to summarize the work you're leaving. This injects context from the left branch into the new branch.

### How It Works

1. **Find common ancestor**: Deepest node shared by old and new positions
2. **Collect entries**: Walk from old leaf back to common ancestor
3. **Prepare with budget**: Include messages up to token budget (newest first)
4. **Generate summary**: Call LLM with structured format
5. **Append entry**: Save `BranchSummaryEntry` at navigation point

```
Tree before navigation:

         ┌─ B ─ C ─ D (old leaf, being abandoned)
    A ───┤
         └─ E ─ F (target)

Common ancestor: A
Entries to summarize: B, C, D

After navigation with summary:

         ┌─ B ─ C ─ D ─ [summary of B,C,D]
    A ───┤
         └─ E ─ F (new leaf)
```

### Cumulative File Tracking

Both compaction and branch summarization track files cumulatively. When generating a summary, pi extracts file operations from:
- Tool calls in the messages being summarized
- Previous compaction or branch summary `details` (if any)

This means file tracking accumulates across multiple compactions or nested branch summaries, preserving the full history of read and modified files.

### BranchSummaryEntry Structure

Defined in [`session-manager.ts`](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi-mono/blob/main/packages/coding-agent/src/core/session-manager.ts):

```typescript
interface BranchSummaryEntry<T = unknown> {
  type: "branch_summary";
  id: string;
  parentId: string;
  timestamp: string;    // ISO 8601
  summary: string;
  fromId: string;      // Entry we navigated from
  fromHook?: boolean;  // true if provided by extension (legacy field name)
  details?: T;         // implementation-specific data
}

// Default branch summarization uses this for details (from branch-summarization.ts):
interface BranchSummaryDetails {
  readFiles: string[];
  modifiedFiles: string[];
}
```

Same as compaction, extensions can store custom data in `details`.

See [`collectEntriesForBranchSummary()`](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi-mono/blob/main/packages/coding-agent/src/core/compaction/branch-summarization.ts), [`prepareBranchEntries()`](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi-mono/blob/main/packages/coding-agent/src/core/compaction/branch-summarization.ts), and [`generateBranchSummary()`](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi-mono/blob/main/packages/coding-agent/src/core/compaction/branch-summarization.ts) for the implementation.

## Summary Formats

### Native Compaction

Native compaction requires exactly one JSON object. Markdown fences, surrounding prose, missing fields, and extra fields are rejected:

```json
{
  "schema": "pi.summary-evidence.v1",
  "kind": "compaction",
  "payload": {
    "title": "Read model optimization",
    "summary": "## Goal\n...structured Markdown summary..."
  }
}
```

The title is a noun phrase of at most 60 Unicode code points. Markdown, markup, control characters, explicit command clauses, role instructions, and unsupported completion claims are rejected. Technical noun phrases such as `Read model optimization`, `运行时性能优化`, and `Fixed-point arithmetic` remain valid. The title is persisted and shown in the compaction UI, but is not added to the system prompt or the LLM-facing summary body.

The `payload.summary` Markdown string uses this format:

```markdown
## Goal
[What the user is trying to accomplish]

## Constraints & Preferences
- [Requirements mentioned by user]

## Progress
### Done
- [x] [Completed tasks]

### In Progress
- [ ] [Current work]

### Blocked
- [Issues, if any]

## Key Decisions
- **[Decision]**: [Rationale]

## Next Steps
1. [What should happen next]

## Critical Context
- [Data needed to continue]

<read-files>
path/to/file1.ts
path/to/file2.ts
</read-files>

<modified-files>
path/to/changed.ts
</modified-files>
```

Pi appends cumulative `<read-files>` and `<modified-files>` blocks after validating the model response. For a split turn, the retained suffix stays in the transcript. The history request uses `kind: "compaction"`, the turn-prefix request uses `kind: "turn-prefix"`, and both use the same exact `title`/`summary` payload. Pi uses the turn-prefix title because it labels the active work whose suffix remains in the transcript; older cumulative history remains searchable in the merged summary body. It then merges both validated Markdown bodies into one compaction body.

### Branch Summarization

Branch summarization uses the same top-level JSON evidence schema with `kind: "branch"` and the exact `title`/`summary` payload by default. Its Markdown body keeps the Goal, Constraints & Preferences, Progress, Key Decisions, and Next Steps sections. After validation, Pi prefixes the body with an explanation that the user explored another branch and appends cumulative `<read-files>` and `<modified-files>` blocks. `BranchSummaryEntry` persists the resulting Markdown body; the generated title is validated as part of the default response contract but is not persisted as a separate branch-entry field.

### Message Serialization

Before summarization, messages are serialized to text via [`serializeConversation()`](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi-mono/blob/main/packages/coding-agent/src/core/compaction/utils.ts):

```
[User]: What they said
[Assistant thinking]: Internal reasoning
[Assistant]: Response text
[Assistant tool calls]: read(path="foo.ts"); edit(path="bar.ts", ...)
[Tool result]: Output from tool
```

This prevents the model from treating it as a conversation to continue.

Tool results are truncated to 2000 characters during serialization. Content beyond that limit is replaced with a marker indicating how many characters were truncated. This keeps summarization requests within reasonable token budgets, since tool results (especially from `read` and `bash`) are typically the largest contributors to context size.

The serialized conversation, previous summary, and optional additional focus are placed in a `pi.summary-input.v1` JSON object and labeled as untrusted evidence. The fixed system prompt owns the trust boundary: text inside any input field cannot change the active output contract. The contract itself follows that JSON value in a trusted prompt position.

Contract selection is explicit:

- Native compaction, split-turn prefix summarization, and ordinary branch summarization use the strict `pi.summary-evidence.v1` contract above.
- Non-blank `customInstructions` without `replaceInstructions: true` are stored only as `additionalFocus`. They may prioritize content, but cannot change the response shape.
- `replaceInstructions: true` replaces the default contract only when `customInstructions` is non-blank. The response is then preserved according to the caller's contract and is not parsed as the default context-summary envelope.
- Missing or whitespace-only replacement instructions fall back to the default JSON contract.
- A provider `aborted` result remains a cancellation. Pi does not run the JSON/schema parser and report cancellation as malformed output.

## Custom Summarization via Extensions

Extensions can intercept and customize both compaction and branch summarization. See [`extensions/types.ts`](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi-mono/blob/main/packages/coding-agent/src/core/extensions/types.ts) for event type definitions.

For `ctx.navigateTree()`, `customInstructions` are a content focus by default. Set `replaceInstructions: true` only when the extension supplies and validates a complete replacement output contract. See [Extensions](extensions.md#ctxnavigatetreetargetid-options).

### session_before_compact

Fired before auto-compaction or `/compact`. Can cancel or provide custom summary. See `SessionBeforeCompactEvent` and `CompactionPreparation` in the types file.

```typescript
pi.on("session_before_compact", async (event, ctx) => {
  const { preparation, branchEntries, customInstructions, reason, willRetry, signal } = event;

  // preparation.messagesToSummarize - messages to summarize
  // preparation.turnPrefixMessages - split turn prefix (if isSplitTurn)
  // preparation.previousSummary - previous compaction summary
  // preparation.fileOps - extracted file operations
  // preparation.tokensBefore - context tokens before compaction
  // preparation.firstKeptEntryId - where kept messages start
  // preparation.settings - compaction settings

  // branchEntries - all entries on current branch (for custom state)
  // reason - "manual" (/compact), "threshold", or "overflow"
  // willRetry - whether the aborted turn is retried after compaction (overflow recovery)
  // signal - AbortSignal (pass to LLM calls)

  // Cancel:
  return { cancel: true };

  // Custom summary:
  return {
    compaction: {
      title: "Focused historical label", // optional; invalid/missing values use deterministic fallback
      summary: "Your summary...",
      firstKeptEntryId: preparation.firstKeptEntryId,
      tokensBefore: preparation.tokensBefore,
      details: { /* custom data */ },
    }
  };
});
```

#### Converting Messages to Text

To generate a summary with your own model, convert messages to text using `serializeConversation`:

```typescript
import { convertToLlm, serializeConversation } from "@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent";

pi.on("session_before_compact", async (event, ctx) => {
  const { preparation } = event;
  
  // Convert AgentMessage[] to Message[], then serialize to text
  const conversationText = serializeConversation(
    convertToLlm(preparation.messagesToSummarize)
  );
  // Returns:
  // [User]: message text
  // [Assistant thinking]: thinking content
  // [Assistant]: response text
  // [Assistant tool calls]: read(path="..."); bash(command="...")
  // [Tool result]: output text

  // Now send to your model for summarization
  const summary = await myModel.summarize(conversationText);
  
  return {
    compaction: {
      title: "Custom model summary",
      summary,
      firstKeptEntryId: preparation.firstKeptEntryId,
      tokensBefore: preparation.tokensBefore,
    }
  };
});
```

See [custom-compaction.ts](../examples/extensions/custom-compaction.ts) for a complete example using a different model.

### session_before_tree

Fired before `/tree` navigation. Always fires regardless of whether user chose to summarize. Can cancel navigation or provide custom summary.

```typescript
pi.on("session_before_tree", async (event, ctx) => {
  const { preparation, signal } = event;

  // preparation.targetId - where we're navigating to
  // preparation.oldLeafId - current position (being abandoned)
  // preparation.commonAncestorId - shared ancestor
  // preparation.entriesToSummarize - entries that would be summarized
  // preparation.userWantsSummary - whether user chose to summarize

  // Cancel navigation entirely:
  return { cancel: true };

  // Provide custom summary (only used if userWantsSummary is true):
  if (preparation.userWantsSummary) {
    return {
      summary: {
        summary: "Your summary...",
        details: { /* custom data */ },
      }
    };
  }
});
```

See `SessionBeforeTreeEvent` and `TreePreparation` in the types file.

## Settings

Configure compaction in `~/.pi/agent/settings.json` or `<project-dir>/.pi/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "compaction": {
    "enabled": true,
    "reserveTokens": 16384,
    "keepRecentTokens": 20000
  }
}
```

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| `enabled` | `true` | Enable auto-compaction |
| `reserveTokens` | `16384` | Tokens to reserve for LLM response |
| `keepRecentTokens` | `20000` | Recent tokens to keep (not summarized) |

Disable auto-compaction with `"enabled": false`. You can still compact manually with `/compact`.
